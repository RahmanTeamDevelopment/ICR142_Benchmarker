# ICR142 Benchmarker

## Introduction
___
`ICR142 Benchmarker` is an easy to use tool assessing germline SNV and Indel calling performance using the [ICR142 NGS validation series](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001001332), a dataset of Illumina platform based exome sequence data from 142 samples together with Sanger sequence data at 704 sites.
`ICR142 Benchmarker` reports a series of informative metrics with increasing levels of detail from overall calling performance to per site profiles and a one page report summarising both standalone performance and comparative performance with current widely-used open-sourced pipelines. See [Publication](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/3-108/v2) for more details.


## Prerequisites
___
`ICR142 Benchmarker` is available for **Mac/Linux**, implemented in R and requires:
1) R version 3.1.2 
2) A capacity to build packages from source (requires gcc and gfortran compilers).

## Installation
___
`ICR142 Benchmarker` implements strict version control over all packages and dependencies used by changing the local default R settings. Any R session launched from the same tool directory will have these settings, therefore it is strongly recommended to install the tool into a new directory.

`ICR142 Benchmarker` can be downloaded from GitHub from [here](https://github.com/RahmanTeamDevelopment/ICR142_Benchmarker/releases) in either `.zip` or `.tar.gz` format.
- unpack the compressed file
- Go to main directory: `cd ICR142_Benchmarker`
- Install with: `./setup.sh`\
`setup.sh` downloads and installs all required packages and dependencies, automatically creating a `setup.log` file.

## Running ICR142 Benchmarker
___
Once `ICR142 Benchmarker` has been downloaded and successfully installed, run the following command from the main directory of the tool:
\
`./ICR142_Benchmarker --input input.txt --method_name name --genome_build buildNumber [--output path_to_output_directory]`


## Input
___
- **INPUT** file - path to tab separated input file containing:\
`Header line` with SampleID and Location \
`Data` with:
  1. Sample IDs in the [ICR142 series](https://github.com/RahmanTeamDevelopment/ICR142_Benchmarker/blob/master/data/ICR142_Validation_Table_GRCh38.txt)
  2. Paths to 142 [VCF v4.X files](#notes)

SampleID | Location
------------ | -------------
D129031 | path/to/D129031.vcf
L81899 | path/to/L81899.vcf
... | ...

- **METHOD_NAME** - one word variant caller identifier (can be delimiter-separated)
- **GENOME_BUILD** - 37 or 38 for GRCh37 or GRCh38, respectively
- **OUTPUT** - path to exitsting or new folder in which outputs will be created. This argument is **optional**, by default "Output_ICR142_Analysis" folder will be created in the main ICR142_Benchmarker directory.

## Output
___
`ICR142 Benchmarker` generates the following files:
- **Summary.txt** - provides summary performance metrics for the evaluated method, specifically the overall sensitivity, specificity and FDR values and the same three metrics calculated for only base substitutions and only indels.
- **FullResults.txt** - tab separated file containing all of the Sanger validation information from the ICR142 dataset and information on the method’s performance at each of the 704 sites.
- **FalsePositives.txt** - relevant lines of the VCF files for false positive variant calls.
- **TruePositives.txt** - relevant lines of the VCF files for true positive variant calls.
- **Report.docx** - Word document providing a clear variant calling analysis report of the method’s performance on the ICR142 dataset.
Key points from the detailed outputs are highlighted to the user, including information about the method’s performance in the context of existing best practice.

### Column Headings
:information_source: Detailed description of all columns in the .txt files can also be found [here](https://github.com/RahmanTeamDevelopment/ICR142_Benchmarker/blob/master/data/ColumnHeadings.txt)
___
### File: FullResults.txt	
Column_name | Description
----------- | -----------
Sample |sample name in the [ICR142 series](https://github.com/RahmanTeamDevelopment/ICR142_Benchmarker/blob/master/data/ICR142_Validation_Table_GRCh38.txt)
Gene | [HGNC symbol](https://www.genenames.org/) 
SangerCall | the most 3' representation annotated with [CSN](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-015-0195-6)
Type | `bs`, `del`, `ins`, `complex` or `indel` for _base substitutions_, _simple deletions_, _simple insertions_, _complex indels_, or _negative indel_ sites, respectively
Transcript | the ENST ID from Ensembl v65 used to annotate the Sanger call
CHR | chromosome
EvaluatedPosition | evaluated GRCh37/GRCh38 site position, centre of designed amplicon
POS | the left-aligned position in GRCh37/GRCh38 coordinates for variants
REF | the reference allele in GRCh37/GRCh38 for variants
ALT | the alternative allele in GRCh37/GRCh38 for variants
Zygosity | `homozygous` or `heterozygous` for variants based on Sanger call
SiteID | numeric ID within the [ICR142 series](https://github.com/RahmanTeamDevelopment/ICR142_Benchmarker/blob/master/data/ICR142_Validation_Table_GRCh38.txt)
Group | `A`, `B` or `.` see [GroupDescriptions](#groupdescriptions)
<Method_name> | `.` if there is a missing genotype, `0` if site is not called in the submitted call set, `1` if a base substitution is called when Type = _bs_, or integer value `X` if X indels are called when Type = _del_, _ins_, _complex_, or _indel_
ConcordantFinalResult | `no` if either SangerCall is _No_ and method_name is _>0_ or SangerCall is not _No_ and method_name is _0_ or ., `yes` if SangerCall and method_name are concordant
ExactFinalMatch | `yes` if _CHR_, _POS_, _REF_, and _ALT_ all match when SangerCall is not _No_, `no` if _CHR_, _POS_, _REF_, and _ALT_ do not match when SangerCall is not _No_, `.` if there is a missing genotype

### GroupDescriptions
Total_number | Group | Description
------------ | ----- | -----------
387 | `A` | Detection of all Group `A` variants is expected. Failure to detect a Group `A` variant indicates substandard performance
261 | `B` | Avoidance of false positives at all Group `B` negative sites is expected. A false positive at a Group `B` negative site indicates substandard performance.

## Notes
### VCF Files
___
- The `VCF` files must each represent a **single sample**.
- ALT column should contain only **one call** (no multi-allelic calls accepted).
- Any base substitution calls are expected to have REF and ALT values of **length one**.
```diff
- incorrect: REF / ALT of GTCA / ATCA
+ correct: REF / ALT of G / A
```
- `Multi-sample VCF` or `gVCF` files should be parsed to fulfill the above criteria.
  **NOTE:** Remove any lines in the VCF file with a reference call, i.e., GT = 0/0 (only retain variant calls and missing genotype calls). 


## Data Access and Reproducibility
___
To allow reproducibility we provide inputs and outputs generated for [GATK](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk), [OpEx](https://github.com/RahmanTeam/OpEx) and [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant).
