Sample	sample name in the ICR142 Series
Gene	HGNC symbol
SangerCall	the most 3' representation annotated with CSN
Type	“bs”, “del”, “ins”, “complex”, or “indel” for base substitutions, simple deletions, simple insertions, complex indels, or negative indel sites, respectively
Transcript	the ENST ID from Ensembl v65 used to annotate the Sanger call
CHR	chromosome
EvaluatedPosition	evaluated GRCh37/GRCh38 site position, centre of designed amplicon
POS	the left-aligned position in GRCh37/GRCh38 coordinates for variants
REF	the reference allele in GRCh37/GRCh38 for variants
ALT	the alternative allele in GRCh37/GRCh38 for variants
Zygosity	"homozygous" or "heterozygous" for variants based on Sanger call
SiteID	numeric ID within the ICR142 series
Group	see GroupDescriptions below
<Method_name>	"." if there is a missing genotype, 0 if site is not called in the submitted call set, 1 if a base substitution is called when Type = "bs", or integer value X if X indels are called when Type = "del", "ins", "complex", or "indel"
ConcordantFinalResult	"no" if either SangerCall is "No" and method_name is >0 or SangerCall is not "No" and method_name is 0 or ".", "yes" if SangerCall and method_name are concordant
ExactFinalMatch	"yes" if CHR, POS, REF, and ALT all match when SangerCall is not "No", "no" if CHR, POS, REF, and ALT do not match when SangerCall is not "No", "." if there is a missing genotype
	
GroupDescriptions column
Total_numer	Group	Description
387	A	Detection of all Group A variants is expected. Failure to detect a Group A variant indicates substandard performance
261	B	Avoidance of false positives at all Group B negative sites is expected. A false positive at a Group B negative site indicates substandard performance.
